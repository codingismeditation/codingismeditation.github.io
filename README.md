Computer Science is like an art, where we are creators inside the machine world, creating things that impact both the machine world and the world beyond it.

Nowadays, the essence of Computer Science is being lost, as crowds opt in only for jobs and money, not seeing it as a passion.

That's why i have started [> Coding Is Meditation](https://codingismeditation.github.io/). It is a sanctuary for those who treat Computer Science as an art and coding as a meditative practice.

Coding Is Meditation is not for everyone.

It is gatekept by devotion, not credentials.
By curiosity, not compensation.
By patience, not pressure.

This space belongs to those who see Computer Science as an art,
who enter the machine not to extract value,
but to understand it.

For them, coding is meditation,
a quiet dialogue with logic,
a discipline of focus,
a craft refined through stillness and repetition.

If you seek shortcuts, trends, or titles, this is not your place.
If you seek clarity, depth, and mastery,
welcome.
